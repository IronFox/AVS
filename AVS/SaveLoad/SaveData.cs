/*
 * This file and this save scheme are old news.
 * I've already neutered the serialization methods; they all write empty lists.
 * I'm keeping the deserialization methods intact for now, because that affords VF backwards compatibility.
 * But I'm eager to delete all of this noise in time.
 * The date of publication of the new save scheme is March 9, 2025.
 * After several months, I will relish deleteing so much of this old shitty code.
 * At that time, I'll delete this file and SaveManager.cs and
 * VehicleManager.CreateSaveFileData and VehicleManager.LoadVehicle
 * and the field MainPatcher.SaveFileData
